Hello everyone :), quick reminder.
PLEASE read the HTML tutorials. At the very minimum the Setup Guide and the Tachometer since those are there to ensure correct functionality.

(HUGH, "Reading" I know right. The forbidden technique)

PS: Yes when you download it it'll be the usual GitHub .zip + Motorsport Ultimate's .zip. Sorry it's an inconvenience I know. 
It's to ensure the tutorials work correctly. I'll change and fix them with next updates so you guys don't have to unzip twice.

With that out the way. Here's a couple of preview Gameplays:
